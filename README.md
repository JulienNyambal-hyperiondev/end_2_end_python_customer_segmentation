# Customer Segmentation Project

This project demonstrates a simple customer segmentation application using K-Means clustering and Flask. It provides a web interface where users can input customer data, and the application predicts their customer segment (Low Income, Middle Income, or High Income).

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
customer_segmentation/
├── app.py           (Flask application)
├── config.ini       (Configuration file)
├── data_science/
│   └── train_model.py (Model training script)
├── templates/
│   └── index.html   (HTML frontend)
├── requirements.txt (Python dependencies)
└── README.md        (This file)
```

*   **`app.py`:** This file contains the Flask application code, which handles web requests, loads the trained model, and makes predictions.
*   **`config.ini`:** This file stores configuration settings, such as file paths, debug mode, and port number. This makes it easy to change settings without modifying the code directly.
*   **`data_science/train_model.py`:** This script generates synthetic customer data, trains the K-Means clustering model, saves the trained model, the preprocessing object, and the generated data to files.
*   **`templates/index.html`:** This file contains the HTML for the web interface, allowing users to interact with the application.
*   **`requirements.txt`:** This file lists all the Python libraries that the project depends on.
*   **`README.md`:** This file (the one you are reading) provides instructions on how to set up and run the project.

## Setup Instructions

These instructions will guide you through setting up the project on your local machine.

### 1. Install Python

If you don't have Python installed, download and install the latest version from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

A virtual environment isolates the project's dependencies from your system's Python installation. This prevents conflicts and keeps your system clean.

*   **On Windows (Command Prompt):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

*   **On Windows (PowerShell):**

    ```powershell
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

*   **On macOS/Linux:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure the Application

The `config.ini` file contains the application's configuration. You can modify the paths if necessary, but the defaults should work if you have the correct project structure.

### 5. Train the Model

Before running the Flask application, you need to train the customer segmentation model. Navigate to the `data_science` directory and run the training script:

```bash
cd data_science
python train_model.py
cd .. # Go back to the project root
```

This will generate the required model and data files.

### 6. Run the Flask Application

Now you can run the Flask application:

```bash
flask run
```

This will start the Flask development server. You should see output similar to:

```
 * Serving Flask app 'app'
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

### 7. Access the Web Interface

Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. You should see the customer segmentation web interface.

## Using the Application

1.  Select the customer's area, amount spent range, tenure range, and qualification from the dropdown menus.
2.  Click the "Predict" button.
3.  The predicted customer segment (Low Income, Middle Income, or High Income) will be displayed with a corresponding background color (red, orange, or green).

## Deployment to Render

To deploy this application to Render, follow these steps:

1.  **Create a Render Web Service:** Create a new web service on Render and connect your GitHub repository.
2.  **Environment Variables:** Set the environment variable `FLASK_DEBUG` to `False`.
3.  **Build Command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4.  **Start Command:** `gunicorn --worker-tmp-dir /dev/shm app:app`

Render will automatically handle the port configuration, and Gunicorn will serve your Flask application in a production-ready environment.

## Further Improvements

*   **More Sophisticated Data:** Use real-world data for more accurate segmentation.
*   **Different Clustering Algorithms:** Experiment with other clustering algorithms, such as DBSCAN or hierarchical clustering.
*   **Data Validation:** Add input validation to the web interface to handle invalid user input.
*   **Error Handling:** Improve error handling in the Flask application.
*   **Styling:** Enhance the styling of the web interface using CSS.
